# Prerequisites #
I do my best to keep the dependancies to third party libraries as small as possible. All the required tools and libraries given in the next sections are Open Source or available for free.

## Skills ##
SDKs
emphazises some good practicices of the boost community (the anti-chamber of the standard c++ libraries)

## Tools ##
  * A c++ compiler. I suggest [Visual C++ Express](http://www.microsoft.com/vstudio/express), a free IDE available from Microsoft.

## Librairies ##
  * FSX SDK available from your FSX installation DVD (Delux Edition only). Service Packs are available at [fsinsider](http://www.fsinsider.com) or the [MSDN web site](http://msdn.microsoft.com)
  * Windows SDK (formerly Platform SDK) available from the [MSDN web site](http://msdn.microsoft.com)
  * Windows WTL available from the [Sourceforge](http://wtl.sourceforge.net)
  * Boost libraries available from the [Boost web site](http://www.boost.org)
