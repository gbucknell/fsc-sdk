From Flight Simulator X, our favorite game has its standard, official, API. While its probably an excellent news, its use slows to spread within the home cockpit builder community.

# Rational #
Why an other developpement when software, such as SIOC, are already well tested and widely used ?
  * The need for an **open source project** ;
  * To promote **SimConnect** to home cockpit builder community ;
  * For even more **customization and efficiency**, "don't pay for what you don't use" ;
  * A better **debugger** ;
  * For **fun**.
